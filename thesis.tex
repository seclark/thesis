% Current version : February 2017
% Susan got this from Stephanie, who got this from Jennifer Weston
% Jennifer got this from Munier Salem, Munier got it from Yuan Li.
% Munier said:
% Yuan Li sent me this, which she got from Lia Corrales. Then Yuan 
% made changes based on Destry's version Yuan got from Jenna. TeX 
% format adapted from the thesis of Destry Saul, which was adapted largely 
% from the thesis of Takamitsu Tanaka, which was adapted from Emily C. 
% Rauscher which was adapted from David Spiegel, and so on and so forth, 
% probably since dinosaurs.
%
% This version hacked to include elements from Adrian Price-Whelan's, which
% was modified to include elements from Jos? Koiller's
